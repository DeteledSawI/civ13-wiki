# Blacksmith

Being a blacksmith is fairly easy. Get iron or steel, craft things, sell
those things. But there's more than just that!

## Setting Up

A typical set up for a Blacksmith is first, a Smithy. Make a nice place
to craft your things, preferably combined with a store behind locked doors.
You'll need an anvil (optionally you could have a stone furnace for making
steel) as well as an oven for smelting iron. It's recomended to make the
smithing area itself from stone, not wood, since wood isn't exactly the kind
of thing you want around hot, molten metal.

### The Job

The main thing blacksmiths do is selling tools to the public (and wepons if
allowed).Otherwise, sell your good to a merchant so they can export
it. Generally making and selling muskets is bests; swords don't export for much
and are still costly on iron. Guns, on the other hand, can give you a good slice of
reales (depending on the merchant), though you should
never take anything less than 2x the ore it took to make. Such
as a musket: 30 iron ore (the amount a musket needs) goes for 30 reales, so try not
to take less than 60 reales; the merchant is probably gonna be your
best friend in terms of business. The rest, is up to you to decide.
